# Rock-Paper-Scissors

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Want to play a fun theme of Rock Paper Scissors against a computer? Look no further!
Play two variations of Rock Paper Scissors against a computer, with sounds, and a tracked win count.
You are able to change games after selecting one, and the player avatar adjusts as it is winning, losing, or tied!
- Select game type.
- Select weapon of choice.
- Watch each round unfold and see wins tracked for each player.
- Hear sounds for each winning weapon.
- Mute sounds if desired.
- Change game once one is selected.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I had about 1 week to work on this project, I finished the bulk of it in about 3 days and put finishing touches and refactored my code for the rest of the time. I'm in the first quarter (Mod 1) of Turing.

### Contributors:
[Seth Burns](https://github.com/SethBurns) worked on this application. 

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Build a working site from a spec from the ground up, with nothing given to me before hand. I worked with functions, event listeners, event propagation, and audio files. I learned some new CSS like absolute position, and worked more with flexbox.


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

#### Wins:
1. Got audio and a mute button working.
2. Created functional CSS with hover.
3. Created a fun theme and the cleanest code I've written so far, with DOM functions separated from Data Model functions.
4. Created an infinitely scaleable checkWhoWon function that will allow for any array of options, provided that array is ordered properly.

#### Challenges:
1. Hiding and showing elements without ruining the page layout for other items.
2. Creating the infinitely scaleable checkWhoWon function.
